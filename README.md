# Calendar current week

Small extension to add small changes to the look and feel of Google Calendar UI only when we are in current week.

Make sure you have enabled `Settings -> View Options -> Show week numbers` in your Calendar for this extension to work.

Current UI changes:

* Add light green background color to the "header"
